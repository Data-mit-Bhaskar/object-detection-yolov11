# **Advanced Object Detection with YOLOv11**
*A **Semester 1 MSc. Computer Vision & AI** project at **Berlin School of Business & Innovation (BSBI)**, where I built a **YOLOv11-based object detection model** to classify snooker balls in images, achieving **high precision and recall**. This project aligns with my professional experience at **Sakon (GSG)**, where I optimized data workflows and reduced errors by **11%**, and my focus on **AI-driven solutions for real-world applications** like environmental monitoring and entertainment.*

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project leverages **YOLOv11** and **Roboflow** to train an object detection model on a **snooker ball dataset**, simulating real-world applications like **environmental monitoring** (e.g., wildlife/vehicle detection in satellite imagery) and **AI for entertainment** (e.g., gesture/expression analysis). Using **Google Colab** for GPU-accelerated training, I achieved robust detection performance, validating my skills in **computer vision, data augmentation, and model evaluation**—directly applicable to my work at **Sakon (GSG)** and **Mercedes-Benz**.

### **Key Achievements**
✅ **YOLOv11 Implementation**: Trained a **custom YOLOv11 model** on snooker ball images, achieving **high precision/recall** (e.g., 99%+ for specific ball classes).
✅ **Data Augmentation**: Used **Roboflow** for preprocessing (rescaling, flipping, zooming) to improve generalization—similar to my **ETL optimization** at Sakon.
✅ **Real-Time Inference**: Deployed the model for **real-time object detection**, with applications in environmental monitoring and entertainment.
✅ **Model Evaluation**: Visualized performance via **confusion matrices, mAP scores, and annotated predictions**, reflecting my **analytical rigor** at Mercedes-Benz.
